Professor Moshe Plotkin
Web Server Programming
February 2nd, 2018

Hi Plotkin, you may remember me from your undergraduate class ‘Web Programming’. I have been a New Paltz student for nearly 5 years now. Having graduated from SUNY New Paltz with my bachelor’s degree last may, I’ve continued my education and I am expected to graduate with a master’s degree this coming may of 2018. 

I recall the effective curriculum of the undergraduate version of this class and hope to receive a lecture of similar pacing. I aim to learn new information, as well as recollect any forgotten information regarding web technology. I feel this course will be an effective refresher on developing web content, but also assist myself in becoming a faster and more fluent web programmer. Popular web-based languages I am familiar with include: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Python (Flask). Some additional web technologies I am familiar with include: AngularJS, JQuery, Chart.js, SQLite3, MySQL, AJAX, Twitter’s Bootstrap, Google’s AppEngine, and more. Since my previous enrollment in ‘Web Programming’ I’ve been involved in a few web projects, most notably in the development of a live-streaming platform--though it is not currently hosted. I also have intermediate experience in developing android applications.

In this class I hope to familiarize myself with the techniques and capabilities of relevant web technologies. I aim to utilize new skills with particular focus on efficiently creating  responsive and secure web applications. In this course, not only do I expect to become familiar with several web technologies and their effective uses, but I also aim to become fluent with their syntax by hands-on practice. Technologies discussed in this class with abundant effective uses that I am interested in include: RxJS, Node, and more. Understanding these two technologies in particular should prove effective for any number of web projects. Some ways I see myself utilizing skills attained in class include: developing a social-media website or online forum, authenticating users on a web-app via Facebook or Twitter, developing a responsive web-app or game via RxJS, hosting a secure database for a web-app via Node.js, or even just developing a mobile-friendly website via Bootstrap.
